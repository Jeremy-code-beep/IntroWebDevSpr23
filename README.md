I spent as much time as I could tweaking my code but didn't realize until the end that the setup of it only runs in 1440 x 900 px or 2736 x 1824 depending on the size of your computer screen. It totally makes sense because the css is hardcoded to certain left and top values but I just assumed I was working in a more standard computer resolution. 

I found learning the various styles of linking to ID super important as it showed up in numerous tutorials for html and css only features. Because there's no javascript to handle the textfiles/images, each image is an element of a bigger carousel which is navigated and focused on using the links disguised as buttons. The "modern" photo viewer works in a similar way with the photo link navbar taking you straight to the full sized images (still within the scrollable wide view).

There still is a lot of development and tweaking so it runs smoothly on all platforms in addition to being ready to port into a 3js based website next semester. I also wanted to update the models of the controls to eventually run games that I've made through gamemaker (standard 2-4 buttons with joystick for arrow key control). But overall it felt really challenging not using more of the resources the internent provides in terms of bootstrap or js but once it's all formatted and cleaned up I'll be prouder to have it as its own pure html css project.
